# Python Numbers

# There are three numeric types in Python:
# 1 int
# 2 flot
# 3 complex


# 1 int
# Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
# a = 10
# print(a)

# 2 flot
# Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

# pi = 3.1416

# print(pi)

# 3 complex

# z = 5j+10
#
# print(type(z))


# y = 10E1
#
# print(type(y))

# b = 10
# print(type(b))

# import random
#
# randomNumber = random.randrange(100000,999999)
#
# print(randomNumber)

# int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)

# x = 4
# y = 4.5
# z = "10"
#
# a = int(x)
# b = int(y)
# c = int(z)
#
# print(type(a),type(b),type(c))



# float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)



# x = 4
# y = 4.5
# z = "10"
#
# a = float(x)
# b = float(y)
# c = float(z)
#
#
# print(type(a),type(b),type(c))


#
# x = 4
# y = 4.5
# z = "10"
#
# a = str(x)
# b = str(y)
# c = str(z)
# print(a,b,c)
#
#
# print(type(a),type(b),type(c))

# Strings

# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

# print("hello")

# print("It is 'alright'")

# print('he is called "jony" ')

# a = "hello"
#
# print(a)

# multipleData = "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book."
#
# print(multipleData)


# a = "hello world"
# # print(a[1])
#
# for x in a :
#     print(x)

# String Length
# To get the length of a string, use the len() function.


# a = "hello world"
#
# # print(len(a))
#
# b = a[4:]
# print(b)
#


a = "Hello World Ishan Rana"

# b = a.upper()
#
# c = a.lower()
#
# print(b)
#
# print(c)

# d = a.strip()
#
# print(d)

e = a.split(" ")
print(e)
